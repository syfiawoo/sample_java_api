# Programming Assessment
This is a skills assessment test one company I interviewed with sent me. This is my solution to the assessment.

Basically I was supposed to create a Java REST Api that had two endpoints.

The end points were as follows

- ``@post:/event`` insert an event
- ``@get:/event`` find the mean amount of events placed in the last 60 seconds

To run the code:

``mvn spring-boot:run``
